<h1 class="headline">What I'm Doing Now</h1>

<ul>
  <li>My day job is running and trying to grow <a href="https://formkeep.com">FormKeep</a> (and sometimes <a href="https://houndci.com">Hound</a> and <a href="https://upcase.com">Upcase</a>). My professional mission is to get great at building and growing software products.</li>
  <li>Each week, I publish <a href="http://giantrobots.fm">a podcast</a> where I discuss my progress on the goal above.</li>
  <li>I've started <a href="/newsletter">a newsletter</a> where I discuss programming and running software businesses.</li>
  <li>I just got back from a <a href="https://codecation.github.io/">Codecation</a>, where I wrote a bunch of Elm and ClojureScript.</li>
  <li>I'm looking for an awesome life partner. Know any smart, funny, accomplished ladies (or are one yourself)? <a href="mailto:ben.orenstein@gmail.com">Get in touch</a>!</li>
  <li>I'm singing bass in a <a href="http://downtowncrossingquartet.com">barbershop quartet</a>.</li>
  <li>I'm using <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> to manage my day-to-day todos.</li>
